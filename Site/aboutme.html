                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Benjamin Trang (he/him) and I am a aspiring fullstack software engineer. I am currently a senior at James
                    Madison
                    University and will be completing my Bachelors in Computer Information Systems in the winter. I am one of two first generation
                    children of two Cantonese immigrants. I built my first computer at 13 years old and never looked back, I then fell in love with
                    programming my first year in college, I learned some simple python and that was that. Im hoping to eventually help build a better
                    world using my code in this growing age of technology.

                <h2>Esports...</h2>
                <p>
                    After completing my associates degree and completing my transfer, I took a two year hiatus. I wanted to pursue a
                    personal passion of mine, which was to play video games for money! As my family loves to remind me, I was born with the
                    "competitive gene". From Counter Strike, Call of Duty, and Halo I grew up always around first person shooters. During my
                    first couple years in college I got noticed in the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege community and a year later went
                    professional. I got to play online in Challenger and Professional leagues, as well as two LAN events in Dreamhack Austin 2018
                    and the United States Nationals in Las Vegas. As much as I loved the experience, It killed any social aspects of my life
                    between practicing 6 days a week and constant travel, and I never had any free time for loved ones.
                    Toward the end of 2019, I decided to retire to finish college at JMU and spend more time with my friends and family.

                <h2>Other Hobbies...</h2>
                <p>
                    I have many interests and hobbies that keep me sane. I love cooking, art, building keyboards, and music. I grew up in my
                    family's restaurant and grew up around food. Typically in Asian cultures food is a sign of love and I do enjoy cooking for
                    my loved ones. Another one of my hobbies (or a money sink) is building keyboards. A few of my best friends got me into
                    building them and now typing with a regular "keeb" is like using a plastic fork on a steak. Lastly, I really enjoy listening
                    to all types of music some of my favorite artists are Kendrick Lamar, Paramore, and Joji. My partner and I love going to
                    concerts and she is the one that took me to my first one. Hopefully some of these resonate with you and definitely feel
                    free to reach out to me if you wanna chat about these topics!

            <h2>The Purpose...</h2>
            <p>
                I created this website to get myself out there into the tech world. As I have stated before I think that technology is the best way
                to make a positive impact on our planet and society. I want my code to be able to make a positive impact on the the world and
                hopefully
                work at a place that shares the same values as myself.
