                Hello! My name is Benjamin Trang (he/him) and I am a aspiring fullstack software engineer. I am currently a senior at James Madison
                University and will be completing my Bachelors in Computer Information Systems in the winter. I am one of two, first generation
                children of two Cantonese immigrants. I built my first computer at 13 years old and never looked back, I then fell in love with
                programming my first year in college, I learned some simple python and that was that. Im hoping to eventually help build a better
                world using my code in this growing age of technology.

                After completing my associates degree and completing my transfer, I took a two year hiatus. I wanted to pursue a
                personal passion of mine, which was to play video games for money! As my family loves to remind me, I was born with the
                competitive "gene". From Counter Strike, Call of Duty, and Halo I grew up always around first person shooters. During my
                first couple years in college I got noticed in the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege community and a year later went
                professional. I got to play online in Challenger and Professional leagues, as well as two LAN events in Dreamhack Austin 2018
                and the United States Nationals in Las Vegas. As much as I loved the experience, It killed any social aspects of my life,
                between practicing 6 days a week and constant travel, I never had any free time for loved ones.
                Toward the end of 2019, I decided to retire to finish college at JMU and spend more time with my friends and family.
